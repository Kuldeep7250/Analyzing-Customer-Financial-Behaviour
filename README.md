2. **Gender-Based Analysis**: Compare the average account balance of male and female customers to detect any gender-based disparities.  
3. **Top Regions**: Identify the top three states and countries with the highest number of customers and determine the percentage of total customers they represent.  
4. **Loan Correlation**: Examine the relationship between job classification and the presence of housing and other loans.  
5. **Marital Status and Housing Loans**: Compare the percentage of married vs. unmarried customers with housing loans to identify significant trends.  
6. **Account Type Trends**: Identify the most common account type and calculate the percentage of total customers using it.  
7. **Tenure vs. Balance**: Analyze the relationship between customer tenure and their account balance.  

Key Features:  
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Provides intuitive visuals and insights using Power BI to help stakeholders explore data dynamically.  
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Enables informed decision-making by identifying patterns in customer behavior and preferences.  
- **Custom Visualizations**: Includes charts, graphs, and filters to make data exploration straightforward and impactful.
